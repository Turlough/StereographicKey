This loads a 3D model, key.obj and displays it stereographically for red-green glasses.
key.obj is in Wavefront format, and is loaded and displayed using the j3d library.

The key is rendered from two points, corresponding to each eye. The views are transparent green and transparent red.
This causes difficulty because the back of the obect is also partly visible, and confuses the effect.

The key can be rotated using left and right arrow keys.

TODO: Create an interpolation algorithm on each screen buffer before rendering.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
